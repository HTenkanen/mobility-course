Exercises 1-2
=============

How to get started?
-------------------

Download the `material package <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IuBOAPFPeoLMmb0eg_GJYrhy8RP6gytw/view?usp=sharing>`__ if you haven't done it already. From this Zip file, you can find the `exercises` directory
and the Notebooks containing the instructions for the exercises. Notice that the Zipfile is relatively large (approx. 200 Mb) because it contains all the data needed
for the exercises (+ extra data for Augsburg).

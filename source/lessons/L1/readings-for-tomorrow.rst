Readings for tomorrow
=====================

Tomorrow morning we will go through a couple papers relating to the topic of this course. You will be divided into two groups and the idea is that
the group 1 will teach the key ideas in their paper for group 2, and vice versa.

The selected papers are:

- Banister, D. (2008). The sustainable mobility paradigm. *Transport Policy*, 15: 2, 73-80. (`download the paper here <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bznCeHHm2EnZyL7QIaiR6McjL3201USF/view?usp=sharing>`__).
